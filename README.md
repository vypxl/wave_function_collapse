# Wave function collapse

This is an experimentation project around the idea of wave function collapse
for procedural generation. The idea stems from [msgmn](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse).

This project is written in crystal, using my game library [scar](https://github.com/vypxl/scar).
